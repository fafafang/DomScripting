    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p id="intro">
        We Bare Bears is an American multinational animated series created by Daniel Chong for Cartoon Network.
        The show follows three bear siblings, Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear (respectively voiced by Eric Edelstein,
        Bobby Moynihan, and Demetri Martin), and their awkward attempts at integrating with the human world in the San
        Francisco Bay Area.
        The series was based on Chong's webcomic The Three Bare Bears, and the pilot episode made its world premiere at
        the KLIK!
        Amsterdam Animation Festival, where it won in the "Young Amsterdam Audience" category. The show premiered on
        July 27,
        2015 and ended on September 7, 2020 with the release of We Bare Bears: The Movie and ran for four seasons and
        140 episodes.
